# Technical-Assessment

# Please email at kmurugathas@gmail.com, if you have any issues downloading the repo
# Part 1 took less than 60 minutes ~ 45 minutes as for guesstimate. 
# Total proj took 4 days (2 days to be exact, some days were used just for minor commits) (Test classes + Learning Java Swing + Comments + Research + Design Choices) (work a 9-5 job so it was hard balancing both)
